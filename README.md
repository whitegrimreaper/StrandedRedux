# StrandedRedux
A Stranded sci-fi roguelike based on my 2015 GGJ game by the same name. The previous game was an idle game, where you play as the captain of a ship, directing your crew to complete tasks in order to escape from the abandoned ship you were stuck on.

Stranded Redux is an attempt to take that original vision and transform it into a fully realized 2D rogulike with procedurally generated levels to explore.

Stranded Redux is built with Unity
